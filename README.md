Some example programs which I will mention on my presentation at the APH National coding symposium 2022

I will be presenting about Getting started with Python at the National Coding Symposium 2022.
As I won't have time to explain and individually share all the programs, I have created this GitHub repository so people can see them afterwoods.

## Getting Started
• I recommend you fork this repository to get a copy for yourself that you can edit, which will help you practice Git.
• In order to run any Python programs you will first need to install Python.
• The process varies by operating system and you can find instructions on the Python website at python.org
• Once you have opened one of these programs, you may hear something strange such as C:\users... This is normal. If nothing more happens, just press enter to start the program. I have designed them this way so that they are more accessible.
• To read output after it has already been spoken, try the JAWS cursor (if using JAWS) with Caps+P to enable and Caps+; to disable. If using NVDA, view output with browse mode by pressing Caps+UppArrow to go through output, no need to turn anything off afterwards
• To view the code or edit the programs, you can use the pre-installed Notepad. However, I strongly recommend using EdSharp or VSCode instead as they are built for coding (unlike Notepad).
• Any lines starting with a hashtag, pronounced # by your screen reader, are just comments to tell you what the code does. You can have fun editing these if you like, they won't do anything to the code.
• Indents in Python really matter (you need them in both loops and if statements).
• If you need to close a Python program while it is running, use the Control+C command.
• If you would like to bug fix, you will need access to a command line.
• Only play around with the AI project folder after you know your Python basics.
